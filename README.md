# Frontend Mentor - Interactive Comments Section

This is my solution to the [Interactive Comments Section challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-comments-section-iG1RugEG9). The goal was to build a fully interactive comments section with responsive design, CRUD functionality, upvoting/downvoting, and localStorage persistence.
